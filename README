Dir Tree

A little Ruby utility to print out an ASCII tree representation of the current and child directories along with its contents.

Example:


A few switches are for filtering results or affecting the display.
only - display only directories, not individual files
full - flat, full (relative) path of files instead of default tree-structure presentation
-img omit image files (graphics, docs, movies, audio) from results
-bin omit executables
date YYYY-MM-DD[..[YYYY-MM-DD]] show only files modified within date range
